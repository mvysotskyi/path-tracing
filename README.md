### Requirements

OpenGL, glfw 

Install up to your system

### Usage:

To compile our project you can simply use CMakeLists.txt

After running binary file, the pathtracer window will pop up.

The image will get progressively better with time as it is sampling new rays.

### Results:

Example of pathtracing with spheres
